This is the readme file for the personal blog challenge! Week 3 challenge 5! 

This repo contains both the html, css and the javascript files for the Kanban task board!

Feel free to explore any or all of these files! 

Basic code was added already, just had to add the functions under the TODOs. 

I hope I am not using Google too much. 



One thing I am still not able to perfect is linking css/javascript files from another folder in the html file. 
This is where I will loose points, but the website should be working perfectly except for the links.

P.S Just arrived from the flight back home. Was'nt able to link css/js files properly. Still have to master that skill.
